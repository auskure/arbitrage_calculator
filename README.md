# Arbitrage Analysis Tool - A Jupyter Notebook and Python Script Example

## Description:

This repository provides both an interactive Jupyter Notebook and a standalone Python script to demonstrate a simple arbitrage analysis tool.

## Requirements:

To install requirements, run the following.

`cd arbitrage`
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Jupyter Notebook:

For a detailed, step-by-step exploration of the analysis process, you can view the Jupyter Notebook: analysis.ipynb

This approach allows you to experiment with code cells, visualize data, and gain a deeper understanding of the workflow.

## Python Script:

If you prefer a streamlined, executable version, head over to the python_script_version folder: /python_script_version

Run the script by executing the following command in your terminal:
`python main.py`

Use code with caution.

This will execute the code directly, providing the results without the interactive environment of a notebook.

A successful run will have the following output:

`Price change graph successfully saved in ./results/priceComparison.png`

`Completed successfully! Check ./results/calculation.txt`

## Credits
This code was adapted from the arbitrage trading algorithm of [Spencer Pao](https://github.com/SpencerPao). It has been refactored, and additonal features have been added, such as the ability to vary trading fees, specify minimum volume per trade, and minimum profit per trade.  I am open to more suggestions of different features to be added.
